1
00:01:16,819 --> 00:01:19,659
I believe in America.

2
00:01:19,739 --> 00:01:22,700
America has made my fortune.

3
00:01:22,789 --> 00:01:26,920
And I raised my daughter
in the American fashion.

4
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,840
I gave her freedom, but I taught her
never to dishonor her family.

5
00:01:33,299 --> 00:01:36,420
She found a boyfriend, not an Italian.

6
00:01:36,509 --> 00:01:40,930
She went to the movies with him.
She stayed out late.

7
00:01:41,009 --> 00:01:42,719
I didn't protest.

8
00:01:43,810 --> 00:01:48,520
Two months ago he took her for a drive
with another boyfriend.

9
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:52,189
They made her drink whiskey

10
00:01:52,270 --> 00:01:56,650
and then they tried to
take advantage of her.

11
00:01:56,740 --> 00:02:00,870
She resisted, she kept her honor.

12
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:05,200
So they beat her like an animal.

13
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:12,000
When I went to the hospital,
her nose was broken,

14
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:16,550
her jaw was shattered,
held together by wire.

15
00:02:18,759 --> 00:02:22,180
She couldn't even weep
because of the pain.

16
00:02:24,219 --> 00:02:27,729
But I wept. Why did I weep?

17
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,729
She was the light of my life.

18
00:02:34,689 --> 00:02:36,400
Beautiful girl.

19
00:02:40,069 --> 00:02:43,030
Now she will never be beautiful again.

20
00:02:49,579 --> 00:02:50,960
Sorry.

21
00:02:59,259 --> 00:03:03,930
I went to the police,
like a good American.

22
00:03:04,009 --> 00:03:06,680
These two boys were brought to trial.

23
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:10,560
The judge sentenced them
to three years in prison,

24
00:03:10,639 --> 00:03:12,770
but suspended the sentence.

25
00:03:13,939 --> 00:03:18,939
Suspended the sentence!
They went free that very day!

26
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:24,530
I stood in the courtroom like a fool.

27
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:28,120
Those two bastards, they smiled at me.

28
00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:34,960
Then I said to my wife, "For justice,
we must go to Don Corleone."

29
00:03:40,379 --> 00:03:44,759
Why did you go to the police?
Why didn't you come to me first?

30
00:03:44,889 --> 00:03:50,979
What do you want of me? Tell me
anything, but do what I beg you to do.

31
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:52,729
What is that?

32
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:05,699
I want them dead.

33
00:04:17,339 --> 00:04:19,129
That I cannot do.

34
00:04:20,459 --> 00:04:22,970
I'll give you anything you ask.

35
00:04:25,259 --> 00:04:30,889
I've known you many years, but this
is the first time you've asked for help.

36
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:37,110
I can't remember the last time
you invited me for a cup of coffee.

37
00:04:38,269 --> 00:04:42,029
Even though my wife is godmother
to your only child.

38
00:04:42,110 --> 00:04:47,120
But let's be frank here.
You never wanted my friendship.

39
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:50,949
And you were afraid to be in my debt.

40
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,449
I didn't want to get into trouble.

41
00:04:54,579 --> 00:04:56,209
I understand.

42
00:04:57,709 --> 00:05:00,589
You found Paradise in America.

43
00:05:02,879 --> 00:05:07,550
You made a good living, had police
protection and there were courts of law.

44
00:05:07,639 --> 00:05:10,350
You didn't need a friend like me.

45
00:05:11,889 --> 00:05:15,560
But now you come to me and say,

46
00:05:15,639 --> 00:05:18,060
"Don Corleone, give me justice."

47
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:22,819
But you don't ask with respect.

48
00:05:22,899 --> 00:05:27,610
You don't offer friendship. You don't
even think to call me Godfather.

49
00:05:29,319 --> 00:05:36,209
You come on my daughter's wedding
day and ask me to murder for money.

50
00:05:36,290 --> 00:05:38,829
I ask you for justice.

51
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:41,920
That is not justice.
Your daughter is alive.

52
00:05:42,959 --> 00:05:46,420
Let them suffer, then, as she suffers.

53
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:50,850
How much shall I pay you?

54
00:06:05,529 --> 00:06:09,449
Bonasera, Bonasera.

55
00:06:09,529 --> 00:06:13,620
What have I ever done to make you
treat me so disrespectfully?

56
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:17,290
If you'd come in friendship,

57
00:06:17,370 --> 00:06:21,790
the scum that ruined your daughter
would be suffering this very day.

58
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:28,089
And if an honest man like you should
make enemies, they'd be my enemies.

59
00:06:31,009 --> 00:06:33,850
And then they would fear you.

60
00:06:37,350 --> 00:06:39,480
Be my friend?

61
00:06:43,439 --> 00:06:44,980
Godfather?

62
00:06:49,319 --> 00:06:50,529
Good.

63
00:06:52,659 --> 00:06:57,829
Some day, and that day may never
come, I'll ask a service of you.

64
00:06:59,209 --> 00:07:01,329
But until that day

65
00:07:03,129 --> 00:07:07,420
accept this justice as a gift
on my daughter's wedding day.

66
00:07:07,509 --> 00:07:09,920
- GrÃ¡zie, Godfather.
- Prego.

67
00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:19,680
Give this to Clemenza.

68
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:25,439
I want people that aren't going to
get carried away.

69
00:07:25,519 --> 00:07:29,689
We're not murderers,
in spite of what this undertaker says.

70
00:07:54,970 --> 00:07:58,389
- Where's Michael?
- Don't worry, he'll be here.

71
00:07:59,519 --> 00:08:02,600
We're not taking the picture
without Michael.

72
00:08:08,939 --> 00:08:11,399
- What's the matter?
- It's Michael.

73
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,750
Don Barzini.

74
00:09:19,049 --> 00:09:22,429
Hey, Paulie! Let me have some wine.

75
00:09:22,519 --> 00:09:24,769
Paulie! More wine.

76
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:31,820
- You look terrific on the floor.
- Are you a dance judge or something?

77
00:09:31,899 --> 00:09:34,149
Take a walk and do your job.

78
00:09:41,909 --> 00:09:45,159
Sandra, watch the kids.
Don't let them run wild.

79
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:47,710
You watch yourself, all right?

80
00:10:08,850 --> 00:10:13,110
20, 30 grand. In small bills, cash.

81
00:10:14,070 --> 00:10:16,440
In that little silk purse.

82
00:10:16,529 --> 00:10:20,110
If this were somebody else's wedding...
Sfortunato!

83
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,450
Hey, Paulie!

84
00:10:21,529 --> 00:10:25,330
I got two gabagool, capocol,
and a prosciut.

85
00:10:25,409 --> 00:10:26,500
Stupid jerk!

86
00:10:35,629 --> 00:10:37,549
What's the matter?

87
00:10:49,809 --> 00:10:52,399
- Have to go back to work.
- Tom.

88
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:56,730
No Sicilian can refuse any request
on his daughter's wedding day.

89
00:11:02,450 --> 00:11:07,580
Don Corleone, I'm honored and
grateful that you have invited me.

90
00:11:12,419 --> 00:11:15,629
Get out of here!
It's a private party. Go on!

91
00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:19,669
What is it? It's my sister's wedding.

92
00:11:26,259 --> 00:11:28,970
Goddamn FBI don't respect nothing!

93
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:35,360
Come here, come here, come here!

94
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:54,169
...but towards the end, he was paroled
to help with the American war effort,

95
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:57,340
so for six months
he's worked in my pastry shop.

96
00:11:57,419 --> 00:12:00,169
Nazorine, what can I do for you?

97
00:12:00,259 --> 00:12:02,220
Now that the war is over,

98
00:12:02,299 --> 00:12:06,299
this boy, Enzo, they want to
repatriate him back to Italy.

99
00:12:06,389 --> 00:12:11,269
Godfather, I have a daughter.
You see, she and Enzo...

100
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:16,980
You want Enzo to stay in this country,
and your daughter to be married.
