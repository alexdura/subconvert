1
00:01:16,819 --> 00:01:19,659
I believe in America.

2
00:01:19,739 --> 00:01:22,700
America has made my fortune.

3
00:01:22,789 --> 00:01:26,920
And I raised my daughter
in the American fashion.

4
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,840
I gave her freedom, but I taught her
never to dishonor her family.

5
00:01:33,299 --> 00:01:36,420
She found a boyfriend, not an Italian.

6
00:01:36,509 --> 00:01:40,930
She went to the movies with him.
She stayed out late.

7
00:01:41,009 --> 00:01:42,719
I didn't protest.

8
00:01:43,810 --> 00:01:48,520
Two months ago he took her for a drive
with another boyfriend.

9
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:52,189
They made her drink whiskey

10
00:01:52,270 --> 00:01:56,650
and then they tried to
take advantage of her.
